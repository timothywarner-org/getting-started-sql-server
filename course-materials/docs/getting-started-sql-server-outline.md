| Learner Profile *Who will be taking this course?* | This course is for IT professionals and developers who need to take ownership of Microsoft SQL Server in an enterprise environment. They may work in operations, infrastructure, helpdesk, or adjacent dev/data roles, and suddenly find themselves responsible for maintaining, querying, or troubleshooting a SQL Server instance.  Most learners are new to SQL Server administration specifically, but they likely bring experience with Windows-based infrastructure, scripting, or general database concepts. They're pressed for time, overloaded with responsibility, and want hands-on demos that show (not just tell) how to get up and running fast with the technology. |
| Learner Prerequisites *What do they already know?* | Learners should already be able to:   * Navigate Windows 10 or 11 confidently. * Use command-line tools like PowerShell or Command Prompt at a basic level. * Understand general database terms (tables, rows, columns). * Follow tutorials and install software with administrator privileges.   No SQL Server experience is required. Prior exposure to relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) is helpful but not assumed. |
| Storyline *Create a realistic story using a* [*PS Brand Asset*](https://authors.pluralsight.com/course-assets/#characters-2021) *and explain how the learner is going to solve it.* | You’ve just inherited the database stack at Globomantics, a rapidly growing robotics company with systems built on SQL Server. The original DBA is long gone. The exec team needs daily sales metrics, the developers are begging for access, and nobody knows how anything is configured.  Your job: take control of the situation, quickly learn how to connect to the system, inspect what’s running, and start managing it like a pro.  This course drops you directly into that admin seat. Step-by-step, you'll build real-world confidence using SQL Server Management Studio, Visual Studio Code with the MSSQL extension, T-SQL scripts, and PowerShell 7. |
| Platform/Tool Versions | |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | Technology | Version(s) | Pre-release? (Y/N) | | SQL Server (Developer) | 2022 RTM or latest cumulative update | No | | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) | 20.x (latest stable) | No | | Visual Studio Code | Latest stable (August 2025) | No | | MSSQL Extension for VS Code | 1.18.0 or latest | No | | sqlcmd | Bundled with SSMS 20.x or latest CLI | No | | PowerShell | 7.x (Core) | No |   Note: Although SQL Server runs on Linux, macOS, and in Docker containers, we’ll stay primarily with Windows here to remain within the Microsoft technology stack as much as possible. That said, I will touch on how to do the work in the other environments at points throughout the training. |
| Short Description *250 character limit* | You’ve inherited a SQL Server instance and need to get your bearings fast. This course will teach you how to connect, explore, and confidently perform essential administrative tasks using real tools and real data. |
| Long Description *Introductory statement, general overview, 3 main learning points, what the learner will know by the end of the course.* | Many enterprise environments rely on SQL Server, yet new admins are often dropped into the deep end without proper guidance. In this course, Getting Started with SQL Server Administration, you’ll gain the ability to connect to and manage SQL Server using real tools in practical scenarios.  First, you’ll explore how to connect to SQL Server instances using SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio Code with the MSSQL extension.  Next, you’ll discover how to navigate server architecture, manage objects, and execute essential Transact-SQL (T-SQL) commands.  Finally, you’ll learn how to configure services, troubleshoot connectivity, and run admin scripts using PowerShell 7.  When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and confidence to begin administering SQL Server in an enterprise environment - whether on-prem, hybrid, or in the cloud. |
